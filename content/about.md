I'm *Benedict Gaster*, a resercher, programmer, and teacher. I work at the [Univeristy of West of England](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/) where I am director of the [Computer Science Research Centre](https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/csrc.aspx).

I live in Bristol, UK.

My research covers a broad church, but I'm particularly interested in programming, the system programming language Rust, functional language Haskell, and GPU platforms OpenCL and Vulkan, the design of digitial musical instruents, and Internet of Things.  

Recent work on digital muscial instruments is under the [Muses](https://muses-dmi.github.io/) umbrella project.

For a list of recent papers please take a look at my [work home page](https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/BenedictGaster).
